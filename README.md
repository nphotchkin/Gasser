# Gasser  

> A CLI build tool to transform JS/TS build so you can publish your front end to Google Apps Script for free.

*Note this tool isn't published to NPM yet as it is in an unfinished state*.

 - If your starting a new project that uses webpack id probably use [https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin](HTML-Webpack-plugin)
   or another appropriate libary/plugin for your bundler libary. This is more of an experiment.
